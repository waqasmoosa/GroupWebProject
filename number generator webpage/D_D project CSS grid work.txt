<h1>Dungeon & Dragon Dice Roll</h1>

<p>Each grid has it's own dice with the dice's description in it so the user has clear knowledge of what the numbers mean in dice and roll. Press te button in each grid to roll the dice when desired.</p>

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="item1">The signature die of Dungeons & Dragons, and taller than its siblings, the D20 rolls further because it is the most spherical. The faces are equilateral triangles.​ The D20 is used any time you want to know if an attempt is successful: attacks, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. Each value has a 5% chance. After you roll a D20 to see if you hit an enemy, you will roll other dice to see how much damage you deal. Small weapons use a D4, larger weapons deal D6 or D8 damage, and the biggest deal D10 or D12.​ D20, The "decider" of D&D dice.</div>
  <div class="item2">The twelve sided die is often used for damage for large weapons carried by a raging barbarian. Each face is shaped like a pentagon. These dice also stack very well for those long dice-stacking intervals between combat turns.</div>
  <div class="item3">The ten sided die is used often while playing D&D. There are actually two ten sided dice in a standard 7-dice D&D set. The faces of one are numbered 0 to 9, and the faces of the other go from 00 to 90 by tens. ​To make a 'percentile' roll, you roll both die and add them together, with one exception: a double zero roll is 100.

</div>  
  <div class="item4">The eight sided die, each face is triangular and it resembles two pyramids attached base-to-base. Often used for damage done by larger weapons.

</div>
  <div class="item5">The standard cube shape die found in most boardgames is also used in D&D. Many gamers gather a set of D6 for quickly rolling multiples, like the original 3D6 rolls for attributes during character creation. This practice later turned into rolling 4D6, discounting the lowest roll, and assigning each number where the player wants.

</div>
  <div class="item6">The unloved D4, also known as the caltrop. If you have stepped on a D4 with bare feet, you will never forget it. Because of its large flat sides it does not roll as well as the other shapes. In Dungeons & Dragons, the D4 is used where you want low variation, and an average roll of 2.5. Determining damage done by small weapons is a common use, as well as use for healing spells.
