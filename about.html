<h1>Dungeon & Dragon Dice Roll Project</h1>

<p class="about_text">
    This website was created as a University of Houston-Downtown computer science Web Development course final project. 
    The purpose of this project was to develop a fully functional website deployed on the internet. 
    This project consists of 5 members:</p>
    <ul class="about_text"> 
        <li>Jose Vargas</li> 
        <li>Waqas Moosa</li> 
        <li>Ismael Moreno</li> 
        <li>Bala Patibandla</li>
        <li>Asad Chaudhry</li>
    </ul>
<p class="about_text">     
    Each member played a different role in coding the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript portion of this website. 
    We developed a Dungeon & Dragon dice rolling website because we not only love to play D&D on our spare time but have been 
    known to argue about the face value of the dice that has been rolled. To bypass this issue, we decided with a website that 
    has a clear view of the dice face value there will be no confusion on the number rolled on the dice. 
    This not only avoids confusion but allows the game play to go by quicker since we can add up the dice numbers with no confusion now. 
    With our rolled number generated we have the attack strength, healing power and success rate of our attack in the game.
</p>

<h1>Future Updates</h1>

<p class="about_text">
    We would like to add a database to our website so we can add username and passwords and we can keep a record of each dice roll number 
    they have rolled. It will give users a better timeline and history of their game play which will allow for a deeper development of 
    storylines in game play. We would also like to add a function in which specific dice roll numbers are totaled so it provides a quicker 
    calculation for the game players.
